              Yes. We offer a 12-month limited warranty from the date of
              purchase. The warranty covers any defects or problems that may
              result from the normal use of the scooter. In addition to 12
              months product warranty, we also offer 12 months of free technical
              support for any repairs, spare parts or any other service you may
              need during the period.
              <br />
              For used certified items, we offer a six-month warranty.
              <br />
              The warranty will not be applicable to items modified by
              customers. Physical damages to the vehicle resulting from an
              accident are also not covered under the warranty.

              No. We do not offer test rides as of now, as we only have online
              stores. However, we are working to make partners with physical
              stores across the USA and might soon allow customers to test ride
              before buying from one of the Currus-authorised stores.

              Well, regular servicing of your Currus E-scooter is a must in
              order to maintain a safe and good condition. We suggest regular
              check-ups for tires, brakes, suspension, and battery. The more and
              better you maintain your vehicle, the longer it will be able to
              serve you. Also, take proper care of the scooter battery. Avoid
              overcharging or undercharging it. Keep it away from direct
              sunlight and rain.
